- **Trade and Reputation: the impact of certification**

   <sub>***Abstract:***</sub> <sub>Raising environmental awareness has led to the proliferation of environmental standards. They aim at helping the organisation to reduce its environmental impact and increase its operating efficiency. Using detailed French administrative data, I estimate the effect of voluntary environmental certification on firms' export performance. I observe that the environmental certification positively impacts the probability to export (extensive margin) and the volume of exports (intensive margin), through an increase of the export price. The probability of export of certified firms increases by 1.4% while the volume of export increases by 10.8% following the certification thanks to a 2.2% increase of the price and an increase of 9.6% of the exported quantity. However, this effect is heterogeneous across destinations, products and across firms: the quantity exported to destinations with higher environmental awareness increases.</sub>

 - **Protection or Protectionism: The Effect of Technical Regulations on Inputs' Sourcing**, *with Irene Iodice*  
   - *Winner of the FIW Young Economist Award'23*

     <sub>***Abstract:***</sub> <sub>This study explores how Technical Barriers to Trade (TBTs) regulations affect firms' sourcing of intermediate inputs and supply chains. We build on the Grossman et al.,(2021a) model to analyse how new standards influence firms' import locations, quantities, and prices. We created a comprehensive database of all TBTs implemented from 1995-2020, integrated with trade agreement depths, a panel of French importers, and a new index measuring regulatory distances between the EU's TBT and input origin countries. Our findings reveal that EU TBT implementations lead to a 4% increase in inputs imported from EU suppliers and a 2% price rise, while imports from non-EU countries drop by 4.5%. This shift mainly affects less developed and EU-disconnected countries, highlighting that supply chain reorganization depends on regulatory adaptation costs. Additionally, supply chains with high relationship-specific investments are less impacted by national standard changes.</sub>
