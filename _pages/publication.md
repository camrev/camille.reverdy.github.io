 Camille Reverdy, *"Trade and Reputation: the impact of certification"*

 *Abstract:* Raising environmental awareness has led to the proliferation of environmental standards. They aim at helping the organisation to reduce its environmental impact and increase its operating efficiency. Using detailed French administrative data, I estimate the effect of voluntary environmental certification on firms' export performance. I observe that the environmental certification positively impacts the probability to export (extensive margin) and the volume of exports (intensive margin), through an increase of the export price. The probability of export of certified firms increases by 1.4% while the volume of export increases by 10.8\% following the certification thanks to a 2.2% increase of the price and an increase of 9.6% of the exported quantity. However, this effect is heterogeneous across destinations, products and across firms: the quantity exported to destinations with higher environmental awareness increases.
